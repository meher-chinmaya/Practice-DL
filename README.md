# ðŸ§  Practice-DL

This repository contains my personal deep learning practice notebooks. All code is written in Python using **Keras (via TensorFlow)**, and executed on **Google Colab** for convenience and speed.

Each notebook includes a direct link to launch in Colab, making it easy to experiment without local setup.
